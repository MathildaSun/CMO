Quick steps
- In your repo: Add file → Create new file → name it `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`
- Paste the YAML above and Commit to main
- Go to Actions → select “CI/CD” → Run workflow
- Ensure these exist in GitHub Secrets: `RAILWAY_TOKEN`, `RAILWAY_PROJECT_ID=fef171ae-4ac5-40cd-beee-fa1f21fbe4f0`, `RAILWAY_SERVICE_NAME=secure-reflection`, `API_BEARER_TOKEN`
- Ensure GitHub Variable `STAGING_BASE_URL=https://cmo-production.up.railway.app`
- After it runs, open `https://cmo-production.up.railway.app/health`

If you still see an error, paste the first failing line number from the Actions error and I’ll adjust immediately.
